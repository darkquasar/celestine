in a little place<br/>
where little hearts are born<br/>
she arrived with her eyes wide open<br/>
sweet blue crystals mortals mourn<br/>

in a little place<br/>
beyond the sea<br/>
she brought to us the joy<br/>
of flowers blooming before your eyes<br/>
of birds singing above the sky<br/>
of all small things that learn to fly<br/>

in a little place where stars go to sleep<br/>
she knew the secret that ancient stones keep<br/>
where day and night pour their waters<br/>
into deep ponds of dust and matter<br/>

she had to depart with the whales<br/>
for a long migration across an ocean<br/>
where we can't follow her<br/>
but as it happens with all small things<br/>
she had the wisdom of the tiny snail<br/>
she left behind a scented trail<br/>
for animals and plants alike<br/>
for life<br/>
to bloom<br/>
